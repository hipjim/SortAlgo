/**
 * Bubble sort, sometimes incorrectly referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that works by
 * repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them
 * if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed,
 * which indicates that the list is sorted.
 * <p/>
 * The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list.
 * Because it only uses comparisons to operate on elements, it is a comparison sort.
 * Although the algorithm is simple, most of the other sorting algorithms are more efficient for large lists.
 * <p/>
 * Bubble sort has worst-case and average complexity both О(n2), where n is the number of items being sorted.
 * There exist many sorting algorithms with substantially better worst-case or average complexity of O(n log n).
 * Even other О(n2) sorting algorithms, such as insertion sort, tend to have better performance than bubble sort.
 * Therefore, bubble sort is not a practical sorting algorithm when n is large.
