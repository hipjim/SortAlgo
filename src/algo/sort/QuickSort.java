/**
 * Quicksort, or partition-exchange sort, is a sorting algorithm developed by Tony Hoare that, on average,
 * makes O(n log n) comparisons to sort n items. In the worst case, it makes O(n2) comparisons, though this
 * behavior is rare. Quicksort is often faster in practice than other O(n log n) algorithms.[1]
 * Additionally, quicksort's sequential and localized memory references work well with a cache.
 * Quicksort is a comparison sort and, in efficient implementations, is not a stable sort.
 * <p/>
 * Quicksort can be implemented with an in-place partitioning algorithm,
 * so the entire sort can be done with only O(log n) additional space used by the stack during the recursion
 * <p/>
 * Quicksort takes O(n log n) time on average, when the input is a random permutation.
 * <p/>
 * Worst O(n^2)
