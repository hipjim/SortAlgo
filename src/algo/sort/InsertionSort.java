/**
 * Insertion Sort
 * <p/>
 * Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time.
 * It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.
 * However, insertion sort provides several advantages:
 * <p/>
 * Simple implementation
 * <p/>
 * Efficient for (quite) small data sets
 * <p/>
 * Adaptive (i.e., efficient) for data sets that are already substantially sorted: the time complexity is O(n + d),
 * where d is the number of inversions
 * <p/>
 * More efficient in practice than most other simple quadratic (i.e., O(n2)) algorithms such as
 * selection sort or bubble sort; the best case (nearly sorted input) is O(n)
 * <p/>
 * Stable; i.e., does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys
 * <p/>
 * In-place; i.e., only requires a constant amount O(1) of additional memory space
 * <p/>
 * Online; i.e., can sort a list as it receives it
 * <p/>
